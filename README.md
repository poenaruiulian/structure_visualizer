# Structure Visualizer

This web application helps students understand how structures work by viewing the changes in real-time. Currently, two structures are implemented: **Red Black Tree** and **Binary Heap**. I've used the resources provided by my university courses and other external docs to implement the structures. The external docs can be found at the start of each structure file, down in the `structures` folder.

The visualization is made using React with the help of the [`react-d3-tree`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-d3-tree) package. This package helped me draw the trees, so I could focus more on the logic behind them.

The project was made for the `Advance Data Structure` course from my university, West University of Timi»ôoara.
